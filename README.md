# PlatformerController

Platform controller for my 2d platformer shooter game
The controller is similar to [soul night](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ChillyRoom.DungeonShooter&hl=en_US&pli=1)
The goal is to implement something close to it but restrict the player from rotating the gun all around the player...

# NOTE
This is a naive implementation of the control in *Godot game engine*
any suggestion is welcomed.
